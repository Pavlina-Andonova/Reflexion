            "description": "The band was formed in may 2009 in Petrich. Back then the crew had a different name-Metal Heart. The genre was hard-rock and the members â€“slightly different- Emil G.(guitar), Petar K.(bass guitar), Stoyan D.(solo guitar) and Tomislava T.(vocal).<br/> From then till now the band went through many changes both in genre and cast members. In 2011 a new drummer joined the band- Ivan K., and a year later- a new vocal- Seraphima M. Also Stoyan D. and Tomislava T. left the band.<br/>Those changes came as a new beginning for the team. They began writing their own music and explore new horizons for the band.",
